## eSolia Members: How to use
1. Create a github account and log in. Let Rick know, and he will add you to the team group in Github.
2. Fork this repository by visiting [eSolia.pro.temp](https://github.com/eSolia/eSolia.pro.temp) and clicking "Fork". This creates a copy of the repo inside your Github account.
3. Go to your Github account home, (click your name) and click Repositories, find your fork and click it. Notice the upper left "fork" icon, and the "forked from".
4. Create a branch for every post you make. Click branch "Master", type the branch name in "find or create a branch". The name should be something like `tarotanaka-post-20150528-win-10-launch`.
5. Click content/post folder and look at the sample and template.
6. Click the `+` next to the path above the file view. Add your file there, like `win-10-launch.md`.
7. Write the post based on the template and do your best to fill out the metadata at the top. Be sure `draft` is set to `"true"`.
8. Once your post is in a pretty-good state, do a "pull request", which makes a request on Github, to merge your post into the source repository. We can then "merge" it from your repo, to the source repo.
9. Make another branch for another post, in your fork.  

Note, there will be a different repo for this site, once the skeleton is done. This is just to get started.
